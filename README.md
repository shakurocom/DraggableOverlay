A `DraggableOverlay` is a Swift library - an overlay that dynamically reveals or hides the content inside it. It can be dragged up and down to stick to predefined anchors. Whenever a drag gesture ends, the overlay motion will continue until it reaches one of its anchors.  `DraggableOverlay` has various configuration options.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate DraggableOverlay into your Xcode project with CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Shakuro.DraggableOverlay'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate Shakuro.DraggableOverlay simply by copying it to your project.

## Usage
Just initilize DraggableDetailsOverlayViewController with your nested viewcontroller and delegate. Nested viewcontroller must adopt the DraggableDetailsOverlayViewControllerDelegate and DraggableDetailsOverlayNestedInterface protocols. The delegate allows to respond to scrolling events.
Have a look at the [DraggableOverlayExample](https://github.com/shakurocom/DraggableOverlay/tree/main/DraggableOverlayExample) (perform `pod install` before usage)
